  preview: "<p> Soon, the public conversation could be entirely or partially generated by AI, according to a report by Europol. But are we ready to accept language models as participants in our democracy? We aimed to explore this question by letting two language models take part in a debate about their own regulation and the spread of misinformation online. These models are not polite or helpful like ChatGPT - they have been trained by researchers at DTU to express sharp opinions that encourage the audience to reflect on the future of democracy in a digital society. The models were developed by PhD student Johan Soltoft, Professor Anders Munk and Professor Brit Ross Winthereik at DTU. </p>",
