  <p>The internet has become a key research focus and a valuable tool for studying social phenomena across disciplines. 
  In collaboration with the DigiFront initiative, ECHO Lab organized a session where researchers presented their projects, 
  showcasing how they utilize the web and web archives as methods in their research.</p> 
  
  <p>Katie McKinnon (KU) introduced the concept of the marginal web through her research on digital traces 
  of Canadian youth in the 1990sâ€“2000s, highlighting ethical approaches. Niels Bruegger (AU) discussed
  the differences between analogue and web archives and how these distinctions change archival 
  methodologies. He also shared a resource on web history and archiving which he has been developing over the years. 
  Oscar Corominas (UAB) demonstrated how private-sector marketing tools, such as Ahrefs, can be repurposed for digital 
  methods. Mathieu Jacomy (AAU) shared methods for scraping the web with LLMs, enabling a more granular approach to 
  web scraping by extracting specific elements of the page.</p>
