  "<p>Computational methods have opened up new possibilities for collecting and analyzing large quantities of ethnographic data, including interviews, comments, articles, and abstracts.</p>"
  "<p>Applying tools like sentence transformers and embeddings, we can cluster and group texts with similar meanings and visualize them, revealing emerging patterns in the data. With these methods, we use a cross-disciplinary approach between computational and social sciences, making it possible to use existing qualitative text data in new ways.</p>"
  "<p>This workshop focused on the practical application of computational tools to ethnographic data. In this experiment, participants engaged in a guided exercise using interviews from their individual research projects. The session concluded with discussions and reflections on how to integrate these methodologies into ethnographic research moving forward.</p>"
