    <p> When working on applications, reaearch proposals or articles, an overview of the existing literature in the field is required. This can take a long time and it can be difficult to navigate the landscape of existing research on a given topic. </p>
    <p> There are a variety of tools that can help with retrieving, sorting, referencing and analyzing relevant literature by visualizing them. A comprehensive introduction and pipeline of tools can help to use existing programs in a meaningful way, and produce literature reviews that encompass the background knowledge needed to account for the need, value and timeliness of a proposed research project. </p> 
    <p> In this workshop series participants were introduced to a number of different visualization and analysis tools. </p> Â´,
